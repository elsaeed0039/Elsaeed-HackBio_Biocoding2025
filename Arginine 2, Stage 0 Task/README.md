## Stage 0 task

This task involves organizing personal information into a simple structure and displaying it.

## Steps Taken

1. **Store Information in Variables**:
   - Each piece of personal information (name, Slack username, email, etc.) is stored in a separate variable.

2. **Display Information**:
   - The details are printed directly using `print` statements, ensuring a logical and understandable output format.

## Code Details

The code does the following:
- Each detail (name, Slack username, email, etc.) is stored in a variable.
- A simple `print` statement is used to display the data clearly, without any complexity.

### Code Implementation:

```python
# Storing personal details in variables
name = "Muhammad Faizan Khan"
slack_username = "Faizan"
email = "faizanjeee@hotmail.com"
hobby = "Learning Bioinformatics Skills"
countries = "Pakistan"
discipline = "Biomedical Sciences"
preferred_language = "Python"

# Printing the organized output in a readable way
print("User Information:")
print("Name:", name)
print("Slack Username:", slack_username)
print("Email:", email)
print("Hobby:", hobby)
print("Countries:", countries)
print("Discipline:", discipline)
print("Preferred Programming Language:", preferred_language)
